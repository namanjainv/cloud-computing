Quiz Q5, 3.30, Summer 2019   (c) DL, UTA, 2019


  C&P means cut and paste only those relevant lines from your program(s) into this quiz.


 1.  I understand that I am on my honor during this quiz, I will not collaborate, use 
     non-allowed sources, and I will not discuss or share this quiz with anyone for the next 
     12 hours.
     You MAY: use Google to search, use previous source code, 
     YOU MAY NOT use:
     Email, Facebook, Hangouts, IM, chats, Skype or ANY other human connection.

     This is a timed test. Late tests will have points deducted for being late.
     Very late tests will not be graded.

     When you are complete, with any part, please raise your hand, so we may visually inspect that part.

     The second part of the test, you should electronically submit, you will need to copy and paste 
     only those lines of code to implement that part of the test, usually a few (two to eight) lines of code. 
     Place it immediately after the question.

     Submit this Quiz (renamed) with code cut and pasted, ONLY text. DO NOT submit zips, binaries, libraries,
     or anything other than text.

     When any parts(questions) are complete complete, submit this test, you may make multiple submissions.

     If you have computer, or other, problems, please raise your hand immediately.

     If you understand and agree, please initial here:
     _________________

 2. Get files from this same folder.
   
 3. Name your program/submission with your name and last digits of your ID.

 4. Using the cloud services provider, all functionality possible should be implemented on that provider.
    (Of course, displaying web pages through a browser and the user interface is "local")
    The cloud service provider is AWS.

 4+ In order to give as many people the opportunity to demo in the last few minutes, you may only demo ONE Question in the
    last 5 minutes of the quiz time or for the few minutes afterward. 

 4++ Missing data is not available, and should not be considered to be zero.
  
Show and submit code, when each part is complete, raise your hand and then show us:

 5. Using k-means clustering, find: 
       first: 4 clusters based on columns Age and Height.
       Show, in textual form, time to run, centroids for the clusters, and number of points in each cluster. 
       then: 3 clusters based on CabinNum and Fare.
       Show, in textual form, time to run, centroids for the clusters, and number of points in each cluster. 
       Display both results on the same web page.
       (no "visualizing", no graphing necessary).
def myClusterDetails(cluster_count, clusters, r):
    kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=cluster_count, random_state=0).fit(r)
    cluster_details = getTableValues(r, kmeans.cluster_centers_, kmeans.labels_)
    return cluster_details


    start = datetime.now()
    q1 = "SELECT age, height from minnow WHERE age is not null and height is not null"
    r1 = execute_query(q1)
    c1 = myClusterDetails(4, ['age', 'height'], np.array(r1))
    time = (datetime.now() - start).total_seconds()
    objs.append({'cluster_details': c1, 'title': "Cluster for age, height", "time": str(time)})

    start = datetime.now()
    q2 = "SELECT cabinnum, fare from minnow WHERE cabinnum is not null and fare is not null"
    r2 = execute_query(q2)
    c2 = myClusterDetails(3, ['cabinnum', 'fare'], np.array(r2))
    time = (datetime.now() - start).total_seconds()
    objs.append({'cluster_details': c2, 'title': "Cluster for cabin num, fare", "time": str(time)})
    return render_template("index.html", part1 = objs)

 6. Create a web form that allows a user to choose the number of clusters to find, and select any two attributes
    (columns) from CabinNum, Lat, Age, Wealth, Education and fare and show, the results, in textual form: 
    centroids, and list the number of points in each cluster. 
    Also show the maximum distance (how tightly packed) between all points in each cluster (in a table).
    (For example a user may enter 10 as the number of clusters to find, and may select age and fare as the two attributes.)

def getTableValues(data, clusters, labels):
    cluster_details = []
    cluster_count = np.shape(clusters)[0]
    for i in range(cluster_count):
        this_cluster_indices = np.where(labels == i)
        this_cluster_points = data[this_cluster_indices,:]
        this_count = np.shape(this_cluster_points)[1]
        this_distance = (np.max(np.sqrt(np.sum((this_cluster_points - clusters[i,:])**2, axis=1))))/this_count
        this_details = {
            "index": i + 1,
            "Centroid": str(clusters[i,:]), 
            "Distance": str(this_distance), 
            "Count": this_count,
            "Points": {
                "x": this_cluster_points[0,:,0].tolist(), 
                "y": this_cluster_points[0,:,1].tolist(),
            }
        }
        cluster_details.append(this_details)

    rules = []
    d = np.array(records)
    r = copy.deepcopy(d)
    for i in string_columns:
        label_encoder = LabelEncoder()
        r[:,i] = label_encoder.fit_transform(d[:,i])
        rules.append({"Attribute": clusters[i], "Classes": str(label_encoder.classes_)})
    r = r.astype(np.float)

    kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=cluster_count, random_state=0).fit(r)
    cluster_details = getTableValues(r, kmeans.cluster_centers_, kmeans.labels_)
    cluster_attributes = request.form.get("checked")

    barGraph = []
    for x in cluster_details:
        label = (x['Centroid']),
        count = (x['Count']),
        barGraph.append({"label": label, "count": count})

    return render_template("index.html", clusters={
        "cluster_details": cluster_details,
        "cluster_attributes": cluster_attributes,
        "attr_count": len(clusters),
        "cluster_centroids": kmeans.cluster_centers_.tolist(),
        "rules": rules
    }, barGraph = barGraph)

 7. On a web form, a user will give a centroid (location) and you will show the name of ANY passenger in that cluster, 
    and that passengers name, age, wealth, cabin and survival.

    wealth = str(request.form.get("wealth"))
    age = str(request.form.get("age"))
    # wealth = int(request.form.get("wealth"))
    # cabin = int(request.form.get("cabin"))
    c_count = int(request.form.get("c_count"))
    selected_attributes = []
    index = []
    selected_values = []
    if len(age) != 0:
        index.append(1)
        selected_attributes.append('age')
        selected_values.append(int(age))
    if len(wealth) != 0:
        index.append(2)
        selected_attributes.append('wealth')
        selected_values.append(int(wealth))
    # if len(wealth) != 0:
    #     index.append(2)
    #     selected_attributes.append('wealth')
    #     selected_values.append(wealth)
    # if len(cabin) != 0:
    #     index.append(3)
    #     selected_attributes.append('cabin')
    #     selected_values.append(cabin)

    attributes = str(selected_attributes)
    q = "SELECT fname, age, wealth, cabinnum, survived FROM minnow WHERE "
    for i, c in enumerate(selected_attributes):
        if c in string_attributes:
            string_columns.append(i)
        q += " " + str(c) + " IS NOT NULL AND"
    q = q[:len(q)-3]
    print(q)
    records = execute_query(q)
    r = np.array(records)
    print(index)
    d = copy.deepcopy(r[:,index])
    print(d)
    kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=c_count, random_state=0).fit(d)

    o = kmeans.predict([np.array(selected_values)])
    this_cluster_indices = np.where(kmeans.labels_ == o.tolist())
    print(this_cluster_indices)
    this_cluster_point = r[this_cluster_indices,:]

    render_template("index.html", partfour = this_cluster_point)

 8. Bonus:
    Using what was done in question 6, showing the same web form, please show a page,
    followed by a either a pie chart or a vertical bar chart on that page, which is at least 80 percent the width of the screen, 
    which has, as a label, the centroid of a cluster, and is proportional to the number of points in that cluster.
    That is: each bar or pie slice should have a label for the centroid of that cluster, and it's size is relative to he number of points 
    in that cluster.
    Each bar or pie slice should be in a different color, please show labels inside or to the right of each bar, 
    or inside or adjacent to each pie slice.
 
<div id = "pieChart" width="80%"> </div>
            <script>
                var pieChartData = JSON.parse('{{ barGraph | tojson | safe}}')
                var count = []
                var labels = []
                // var states = []

                pieChartData.map(function(d) {
                    count.push(d.count[0])
                    labels.push(d.label[0])
                    // states.push(d.state)
                })

                var data = [{
                    values: count,
                    text: labels,
                    type: 'pie',
                    labels: labels,
                    // hovertext: states
                }];

                var layout = {
                    height: "70%",
                    width: "100%"
                };

                Plotly.newPlot('pieChart', data, layout);


 9. Show GTA parts 5, 6, 7, 8(if done)

 10. When complete, return (send) this quiz
     If you finish early, send this immediately, otherwise send between
